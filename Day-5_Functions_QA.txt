## Day-5: Interview Q&A on Functions

**Q1. What is a function in C?**  
**A:** A function is a block of code that performs a specific task. It helps in code reusability and modularity.

**Q2. What are the types of functions in C?**  
**A:** 
1. Library functions (predefined) → e.g., printf(), scanf(), sqrt().  
2. User-defined functions → functions created by the programmer.

**Q3. What are the advantages of using functions?**  
**A:** 
- Code reusability  
- Easier debugging and maintenance  
- Improves readability  
- Allows modular programming

**Q4. What are the different categories of user-defined functions in C?**  
**A:**  
1. Function with no arguments and no return value  
2. Function with arguments but no return value  
3. Function with no arguments but with return value  
4. Function with arguments and return value

**Q5. What is the difference between call by value and call by reference?**  
**A:**  
- Call by value: A copy of the actual value is passed. Changes inside the function do not affect the original variable.  
- Call by reference: The address of the variable is passed. Changes inside the function affect the original variable.
